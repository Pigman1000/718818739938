# My Projects 

Welcome to the **projects** section, where I share the work I’m exploring and learning along the way. Each project is an opportunity for me to grow, experiment, and deepen my understanding. As I continue to learn and improve, I document my progress and hope you’ll join me on this journey. 

Below are a list of my projects , past and present.
Feel free to explore, offer feedback, and share in the process of discovery.

## Bungpui

This is one of my core initiatives, and it is very personal and dear to my heart. It is a dataset project focused on preserving and promoting the languages of Northeast India. The goal is to create a comprehensive, accessible resource that highlights the linguistic richness of this region, which is home to diverse communities with their own unique languages.

Although my knowledge in this field is still growing, I feel a deep responsibility to contribute in any way I can to support my community. While I’m learning as I go, this project allows me to apply what I’m discovering and make a meaningful impact, no matter how small. Every step forward is a chance to help preserve and share the languages that matter to me.

You can check out the rationale behind this project and why I started this journey from this page.

## Lil-Wiki

You can explore the project here: [Lil-Wiki Website](#)

The Lil-Wiki project is a simple Wikipedia website designed to fetch wiki content through the Wikipedia API and present it in a digestible form. The goal was to create a straightforward, user-friendly platform that allows people to quickly access summarized excerpts of Wikipedia articles.

Though the project is still up and functioning on GitHub Pages, it has taken a backseat with no immediate future plans. However, the website remains accessible, and you can still explore its content as it stands.

If you’re interested, you can visit the site and check out the content being fetched and displayed. You can find the repository and more details on [GitHub].

## Termux AI System

This project was the reason I started collecting language data for the **Bungpui Project**. What began as a learning experience (or rather, an attempt at learning) has now evolved into something more.

The goal of this project is to create a personal AI assistant for my phone that can simplify my workflow. Currently, the assistant can play songs and read/write to my internal storage. However, one issue I face is token size limitations, as I'm using API calls. I opted to use API calls rather than running the models locally because running them on-device is impractical.

The project is still active, but I've kept it private for now. It's currently just one Python script, and I've put it on the backburner for a while. Once I feel more confident about it, I might consider sharing it, but for now, it remains private.

You can read more about my insights from this project here. However, please keep in mind that this is still a learning process, and my understanding of the subject—and my approach to what I'm trying to achieve—may be incomplete or even misguided at times.

Thank you for your interest in this ongoing experiment!

## Website Project

This website project started as an effort to bring together all my ongoing initiatives in one place. It serves as a platform to showcase my work, share updates, and provide easy access to my projects. It’s a work in progress, and while the site is up and functioning, I am continuously refining and improving it as I learn.

The goal of this website is to provide clear documentation and resources for those who might be interested in the projects I am working on, like the **Bungpui Project** and **Termux AI System**, among others. It’s also an experiment in web development, where I’m learning and growing along the way.

I’ve kept the website minimal and text-focused, aligning with my preference for a simple, straightforward approach. Although there are no immediate plans for major features, I am constantly thinking of ways to enhance the user experience, improve the presentation, and make the content more accessible.

Feel free to explore the site and check out the different pages and links to my ongoing projects. As I continue working on them, I’ll be sure to update the site with new content, insights, and any major changes.

You can check out the repository for the website [here](insert-repo-link), and you can find the changelog and any tutorials or instructions on how to fork the site in the future.
