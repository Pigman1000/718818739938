What is Bungpui Project?  

The Bungpui Project is a dataset initiative aimed at documenting and preserving the rich linguistic diversity of Northeast India. This project focuses on creating structured datasets to support the preservation and promotion of underrepresented languages, with a particular emphasis on Hmar. The goal is to provide valuable resources for linguistic research, technological development, and the long-term survival of these languages.  

The project involves a multi-faceted approach to data collection, utilizing public domain resources, books, websites, and manual efforts to gather relevant linguistic materials. The datasets include basic words, phrases, grammar resources, and ethnographic studies, all organized to facilitate easy access and use for language preservation and the creation of tools designed to support native languages.  

At present, I handle every aspect of the project myself, from the initial data collection to the creation and management of the datasets. While this is a personal undertaking, I hope that communities and individuals alike will recognize the potential of this project and contribute, whether through collective efforts, collaborations, or individual donations. This support will help sustain and expand the project, ensuring its impact for years to come.  

Looking ahead, I aspire to expand the project beyond its current scope, extending it to other languages spoken in Northeast India, such as Kuki, Dimasa, Meitei, Khasi, Garo, Karbi, and others. This expansion will help create a more comprehensive representation of the region's diverse linguistic landscape and ensure that these languages are documented and preserved for future generations.
