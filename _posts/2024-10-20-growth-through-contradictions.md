I have always thought that coming to a shared understanding or a unified mind is what we should strive for, but I may have been wrong.

I have come to realize that there can be no growth without diversity of thought. I know this is not new information or anything profound, but I suppose I haven’t really implemented this logic in how I process my thoughts, as I’d always dismissed it as hate. I realize that maybe that’s why I find it hard to identify what changed my mind. If this statement is true on any level, it must have had an effect on me, and maybe that’s why I feel the need to mark this chain of thought as basic as it is. Every debate is held not just to validate our thoughts and ideas but as an attempt to change the minds of others, and that demonstrates validity.

It seems the opportunity for growth is most obvious and most well-presented in what we would label hate. However, I doubt I personally have the mental fortitude to handle an opposing thought without it affecting my internal self when it comes from someone I do not respect or know. I understand it's simply a matter of viewing negativity as positivity, but I really don't know how much of it would be acceptable and true, and how much could be labeled a misunderstanding—even from those I know well.

This way of thinking applies not only to information and discussions on certain topics but also to beliefs.

I've changed my mind, or rather opened up my mind, to the possibility of the existence of a higher power, intentionality, or whatever you call it.

Historically, this has been met with violence, which goes against the very concept of embodying the principles of an all-loving entity. Clashes over religious beliefs have persisted. We’ve evolved, and though violence is not how we respond to opposing views anymore, hate and negativity still exist, and that’s true for any religion. The truth remains: how can we ever understand God without this diversity of thought? A lack of diversity would result in a stalemate, and there would never be any more progress. We would never know if what we understand as true is close to the truth if we never challenged our beliefs. That’s the beauty of the chaos in our beliefs and understanding of truth.

The challenge then lies in accepting the most logical conclusion and understanding our roles in view of those who do not share this understanding with us. It becomes not only an understanding but a responsibility—to those who genuinely seek to understand and converse. If the truth someone knows to be true, no matter how illogical it may seem to us, gives them peace of mind, it serves its purpose. It’s illogical to think we can guide them without their consent.

This begs the question: if your worldview is the only truth that is valid and everything else is illogical and deserving of hate and dismissal, why do you enjoy the fruits of the hard work of others with whom you do not share a shred of your worldview?

Self-expression becomes impossible with a unified mind, and while there may be a reality where this awaits us, I struggle to grasp it due to my understanding of individuality and its role in shaping our current reality. I realize there may be truths that I can't yet connect with, but regardless of what the future holds, I believe it's important to recognize the complexity of our thoughts. I see this as the only path forward for personal growth, and identifying this may help in effectively guiding ourselves through change, adaptation, and growth.
