There’s a common misconception that science somehow disproves religion, and the idea that science is inherently more logical in explaining the nature of our existence couldn’t be further from the truth. The claim that the universe came into being with the Big Bang is as unfulfilled as the religious explanation that God created everything.

Religion is often criticized for its perceived illogical nature, primarily due to the laws and rules outlined in religious texts. However, these texts also remind us of our free will. Despite this, we tend to accept the truths within these teachings without fully examining their deeper wisdom, while still adhering to rules that seem illogical, all by our own choice. When things go wrong, we blame God, yet paradoxically, we continue to assert that religion is illogical. Are we not exercising our free will in this process?

The unpredictability of quantum particles, whether attributed to agency or randomness, renders a purely deterministic worldview illogical — making the existence of free will more plausible. Regardless of probability, even if not proven, shouldn't free will be the default assumption logically?

Our inability in expressing the philosophical concept of absolute nothingness is somewhat addressed by the existence of the number zero (0), yet we still seek more proof, even though 0 ≠ 1. We devise theories that come close to the idea of heaven, but find the term "heaven" itself unacceptable, opting instead for terms like "higher dimension" or referring to God as the "Grand Designer" and describing this as "intelligent design." Similarly, we find the multiverse theory acceptable, but the concept of heaven as a higher dimension is dismissed. The Simulation Hypothesis is entertained as a possibility, yet claiming we are creations is deemed illogical. Isn’t this contradiction somewhat hypocritical and intellectually dishonest?

Science often distances itself from the question of intentionality or the existence of a Grand Designer, asserting that its purpose is not to prove or disprove such concepts. Yet, many physicists dismiss the idea of God, even though quantum physics undermines the deterministic assumptions of classical physics, gradually leading us into the realm of philosophical abstraction with each new discovery. I don't claim that science exists to disprove religion or these ideas; in fact, I believe science complements religion in many ways. However, I think it’s important to point out that this hypocrisy is clear to an outsider like me.

Let’s take this further and consider how science came into existence in the first place. Isn’t religion the foundation of philosophy? Doesn’t philosophy attempt to fill the gaps left by religion? And isn’t science essentially an extension of philosophy? The questions evolved from "Why is there pain and suffering?" to "How does the brain process pain?" This shift in inquiry has ultimately led us to create medical technologies aimed at alleviating pain.

It’s only a matter of time before we develop technologies in bioengineering, robotics, and AI, leading us to realize that we embody the essence of God, as religion has long foretold—we are made in His image as creators. As these technologies advance and our understanding of our true nature deepens, we may eventually create our own version of Heaven here on Earth. Aren’t we already beginning to do so? Additionally, with the progress in life extension and the potential to reverse aging, we are moving closer to transcending the limits of mortality. Although these ideas remain speculative, they suggest a future where we may mirror the divine potential that religion speaks of.

I realize how outlandish this may sound, but are we not serious in our pursuit of these technologies? If we have hope, do these bold statements really make no sense? If we’re seriously pursuing these technologies, it must be because we believe they could one day be realized. If not, why bother at all?

Theoretical concepts like **Deism**, which posits that a creator exists but does not intervene in the universe, and **pantheism**, which equates God with the universe, resonate with the idea of a Grand Designer. The **Anthropic Principle** suggests that the universe's laws are fine-tuned for life, reinforcing the notion of intentionality in creation while **The Fine-Tuning Argument** asserts that the universe's specific conditions are conducive to life, suggesting a deliberate design.

Science makes much more sense to me when viewed alongside the belief in a Grand Designer and Heaven as a higher dimension. A vast majority of these theoretical concepts and philosophical ideas fit neatly into this framework. Concepts such as existentialism, which emphasizes individual freedom and the search for meaning, and determinism, which explores the idea that our actions are pre-determined, can complement this view.

I understand that it’s our skepticism and desire to uncover the truth about our reality that have shaped us as a species. While I may be wrong, I believe I now have a clearer sense of the complexity through which we needed to grow as humans to realize our potential as creations. But we will only truly understand our worth as creators when we come to terms with the nature of our existence. By knowing ourselves better, we come to know our creators better, and thus, we become better creators ourselves by embodying their divinity.

This perspective is, of course, my personal opinion, and I recognize that others may hold different beliefs. As we navigate this intricate relationship between science and spirituality, I invite you to reflect on your beliefs and consider how they shape your understanding of existence. Are we not all on a quest for truth and meaning? Perhaps the answers lie not solely in the realms of science or religion, but in the harmony between the two. The journey of exploration continues—who knows what we might discover?
