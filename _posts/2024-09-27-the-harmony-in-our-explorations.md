There’s a common misconception that science disproves religion, and the idea that science is somehow more logical in explaining the nature of our existence couldn’t be further from the truth. The claim that the universe came into being with the Big Bang is as unfulfilled as the religious explanation that God created everything.

Religion is often deemed unacceptable because of the laws and rules written in religious texts. Yet, we have free will, and religion reminds us of this fact. Despite this, we read these truths without trying to decipher the essence of the wisdom in the logical ones, while following the illogical rules of our own free will. Then, we blame God, only to turn around and declare that religion is illogical. Do we not have free will?

The unpredictability of quantum particles, whether attributed to agency or randomness, renders a purely deterministic worldview illogical — making the existence of free will more plausible. Regardless of probability, even if not proven, shouldn't free will be the default assumption logically? 

Our inability to express the philosophical concept of absolute nothingness is solved by the existence of the number zero (0), but we still demand more proof and yet 0 ≠ 1 . We conjure up theories very close to the idea of heaven, yet we find the term "heaven" unacceptable. So, we call it a higher dimension, and we refer to God as the Grand Designer. Now, let’s discuss how the multiverse theory is acceptable, but the concept of heaven as a higher dimension is not. The Simulation Hypothesis is a possibility but saying we are creations is illogical? Isn’t that a bit hypocritical?

Science tries to distance itself by stating that it doesn’t exist to prove or disprove intentionality or the existence of a Grand Designer, yet every physicist seems to laugh at the idea of God. I don’t claim that’s why science exists; in fact, I believe science complements religion better.

Let’s take this further and explain how science came into existence in the first place. Isn’t religion the reason philosophy exists? Doesn’t philosophy try to fill the gaps that religion leaves? Isn’t science an extension of philosophy? Didn’t the questions shift from “why is there pain and suffering?” to “how does the brain process pain?” Didn’t the realization of these explorations lead us to create medical technologies to alleviate pain?

It’s only a matter of time before we develop technologies in bioengineering, robotics, and AI that we’ll realize we embody the essence of God, as religion claims—we are creators. And as we continue advancing in these technologies and gain more awareness of our true nature, we may ultimately create our own version of Heaven here on Earth. Are we not already doing that?

Science, to me, makes much more sense when you believe in a Grand Designer and Heaven as a higher dimension because a vast majority of these theoretical concepts and philosophical ideas fit in neatly. Concepts such as **existentialism**, which emphasizes individual freedom and the search for meaning, and **determinism**, which explores the idea that our actions are pre-determined, can complement this view.

Theoretical concepts like **Deism**, which posits that a creator exists but does not intervene in the universe, and **pantheism**, which equates God with the universe, resonate with the idea of a Grand Designer. The **Anthropic Principle** suggests that the universe's laws are fine-tuned for life, reinforcing the notion of intentionality in creation while **The Fine-Tuning Argument** asserts that the universe's specific conditions are conducive to life, suggesting a deliberate design.

Further, **Teilhard de Chardin’s Omega Point** proposes that the universe is evolving towards a higher state of consciousness, aligning with the concept of a higher dimension. **Process Theology** emphasizes that God is not static but is involved in the process of creation, which harmonizes with the idea of a dynamic universe.

The **theistic evolution** perspective reconciles evolutionary biology with belief in God, illustrating how science and faith can coexist. **Spiritual naturalism** blends scientific understanding with spiritual insights, while **Stephen Jay Gould’s NOMA** posits that science and religion address different realms of inquiry. Lastly, **Albert Einstein’s views on religion** highlight a sense of wonder and reverence toward the universe, suggesting that science and spirituality can coexist.

Additionally, philosophical ideas like **dualism**, which suggests a separation between mind and matter, align with the notion of a higher dimension. **Nihilism** and **relativism** challenge us to think about meaning and truth, while **holism** and **monism** remind us of the interconnectedness of all things. **Chaos theory** indicates that even apparent randomness follows underlying laws, which may point toward a grand design. In contrast, **panpsychism** posits that consciousness pervades all matter, inviting deeper reflection on our existence. Other philosophies, such as **solipsism**, **phenomenology**, and **absurdism**, raise essential questions about reality, consciousness, and the meaning of life.

I understand that it’s our skepticism and desire to uncover the truth about our reality that have shaped us as a species. While I may be wrong, I believe I now have a clearer sense of the complexity through which we needed to grow as humans to realize our potential as creations. But we will only truly understand our worth as creators when we come to terms with the nature of our existence. By knowing ourselves better, we come to know our creators better, and thus, we become better creators ourselves by embodying their divinity.

This perspective is, of course, my personal opinion, and I recognize that others may hold different beliefs. As we navigate this intricate relationship between science and spirituality, I invite you to reflect on your beliefs and consider how they shape your understanding of existence. Are we not all on a quest for truth and meaning? Perhaps the answers lie not solely in the realms of science or religion, but in the harmony between the two. The journey of exploration continues—who knows what we might discover?
