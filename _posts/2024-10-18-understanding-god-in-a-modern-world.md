If humanity had never sought to explore beyond the knowledge of ancient times, when the first religious revelations occurred, and if we had never ventured to understand the world in new ways, we might have found it easier to grasp the concept of a divine creator and our purpose. If science had never emerged, if there had been no desire to understand the physical world more deeply, our relationship with God might have remained simpler.

But as our understanding of the world grew, so did our awareness of God. Along the way, however, we began to realize that our previous understanding of God was limited. Instead of humbly acknowledging our misunderstandings, we divided into factions: some continued to hold on to old interpretations without seeking to bridge them with modern knowledge, while others rejected the possibility of a creator entirely, finding fault with the teachings that had been passed down. In doing so, we lost sight of the fact that religion, at its core, sparked our curiosity to explore and understand the physical world, while the modern world, with all its advances, offers new ways of seeing the divine.

What we need now is to recognize that both our spiritual and intellectual journeys are essential. A society with an incomplete or misdirected understanding of God is a society that risks losing sight of its deeper meaning.

How do we explain the mysteries of the universe—such as atoms—if we believe that only specific religious teachings hold the full truth about God and life? How do we enjoy the benefits of the modern world, built upon science and technology, if we dismiss them as irrelevant or even sinful? Why do we continue to explore the universe if we think our understanding of God is final and unchanging?

These questions, though often repeated, are important. How do we explain the behavior of atoms without believing in intention or purpose? Can zero truly be the same as one? How do we understand the emergence of order from chaos? Where is the evidence of life arising from non-life?

I believe that answering these questions with an open heart and mind can help us better understand our place in the world. In the end, faith will always play a role in how we interpret our existence, but it seems more logical to me to accept the possibility of a Creator rather than to believe we came from nothing and will return to nothing. This belief doesn't stop me from seeking more knowledge; in fact, it deepens my faith and opens my eyes to the signs of the divine around me.

To claim that religion is filled with immoral or illogical rules is to imply that our understanding of life and existence is complete and flawless—that our interpretation of God is final and beyond question. Yet history shows that we, as humans, are imperfect, and our understanding of life, of morality, and of God, evolves. Our perspectives grow and change. To reject this process of growth and change, and to claim that one has a perfect understanding of God, seems to me to be an act of denial.

If we acknowledge that there is so much we still don't understand about the universe, how can we presume we understand the one who created it? If we can't even grasp how the technologies we use every day, like smartphones and computers, function, how can we confidently claim there is no God based on our limited understanding of morality and correctness?

In our journey of faith, it's important to embrace humility, recognizing that our understanding will always be imperfect, yet still worth pursuing. The search for truth—whether spiritual or scientific—has the potential to bring us closer to the divine, to each other, and to a deeper sense of meaning in life.
