If humanity had never sought to explore more than what they already knew back in ancient times, where these religious revelations occurred, and if we had never advanced as a species and our understanding had never grown,

If there had never been a group of people who sought to understand the physical world better, if science had never existed and, subsequently, technology,

It would be easier for us as a species to comprehend the divine creator and our purpose. However, as society grew and our understanding of the world deepened, so too did our relationship with God. Somewhere along the way, we looked back and realized our understanding of God was misplaced. Rather than accept that we were wrong, we divided ourselves into groups: those who continue to adhere to long-held understandings of God without trying to connect them to the modern world, and those who refuse to acknowledge the possibility of a creator because of the illogical rules outlined in religious texts, denying that it was humans who fulfilled and enacted those rules. Now we find ourselves in a position where we've forgotten that it was religion that jumpstarted our quest for understanding the physical world while simultaneously denying that the modern world explains God better.

What we need now is to recognize that all of this was necessary and remains necessary because a society with a flawed understanding of God is essentially a godless society.

How do you explain atoms if only your very specific religious book contains the truth about God and everything that is necessary for humans to survive , thrive and find their purpose ? Why do you enjoy the privileges of the modern world if all of it is considered unnecessary even if not sinful? Why do we continue to explore if our understanding of God is absolute and perfect?

I understand this is repeated content but how do you explain the behavior of atoms without believing in intentionality? Can zero (0) ever equal one (1)? How do you explain order emerging from chaos? Show me evidence of life arising from non-life.

I believe answering these questions can lead us to come to better conclusions but in the end, it’s still a matter of faith and blind belief, but to me, it’s much more logical to accept that there is a God than to believe we came from nothing and will fade into nothing. This belief does not prevent me from striving to learn and know more; in fact, it enhances my faith, and I see signs of it everywhere.

To say that religion is filled with immoral and illogical rules is to accept that our understanding of life and existence is absolute and perfect—that our interpretation of God is what it is and how it should be. It is to deny that we grow and learn as imperfect, illogical beings, which is evident throughout history. Our morals evolve, and to claim that this interpretation of our existence is blasphemy is to assert that one understands God, which, to me, sounds rooted in denial.
