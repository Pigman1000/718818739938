In the 15th century, many feared that the invention of the printing press would lead to societal deterioration and the degradation of knowledge. Concerns arose that the widespread availability of printed materials would promote ignorance, dilute the quality of scholarship, and challenge traditional authority. In hindsight, we can see how those misconceptions limited the understanding of books’ potential to educate and empower. This reflection makes me wonder if there are parallels between society's views on books in the 15th century and our current perception of smartphones.

I recently came across a post about a 10-year-old girl in East Khasi Hills, Meghalaya, who tragically took her own life after her parents took away her smartphone. This heartbreaking incident compels me to share my thoughts, even if they don't significantly contribute to the broader conversation on the issue.

While I can’t fully grasp the pain her parents must be feeling, I imagine it has profoundly impacted them. However, I believe this situation reflects a collective failure to raise awareness about the impact smartphones can have on a child's life. Smartphones, like any technology, are not going away. We need to learn to view them positively and recognize the benefits they offer while also considering their potential negative impacts. Is smartphone addiction a genuine issue, or is it a misconception? Are we leveraging the positives, or merely doom-scrolling through social media?

Instead of restricting access, why not teach our children to navigate the web responsibly? We can set limitations on the websites they can visit. After all, we have information at our fingertips—something our parents claimed they walked miles a day to obtain.

Technology has advanced to a point where all of humanity's accumulated knowledge is instantly accessible, making traditional education seem less relevant. These realizations may seem obvious, yet we often limit our use of technology and revert to mindless scrolling. I have no problem with watching cat videos, but if we’re going to spend so much time on these devices, we should create structured schedules for their use. Fortunately, many smartphones already offer features like kid modes and user profiles. To dismiss technology as inherently bad or to label smartphones as harmful seems misguided.

It makes me wonder if , It’s time to rethink how we can utilize all these technologies more effectively and maximize their potential, rather than denying their benefits while pretending they can’t positively impact our lives.
