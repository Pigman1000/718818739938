Over the past few days (from December 6 to December 8, 2024), I’ve been immersing myself in exploring the process of fine-tuning a language model, and I’m happy to share that I’ve made e some progress. While I realize this may not be groundbreaking to those with more experience in AI, I’m genuinely excited about the steps I’ve taken so far. Given that I’m still a beginner, every small success feels like a meaningful milestone.

And yes , I did use pre-built frameworks, it's way beyond my scope of knowledge to actually create a framework , I'm not there yet but I suppose I'll eventually have to dig deeper.

Although the model wasn’t able to output 100% accurate results and did exhibit some hallucinations, I recognize that this is likely due to the small size of the dataset I created myself. It seems that it might just be lacking in certain areas, and I believe updating the dataset will help improve the model’s performance.

Looking ahead, I’m considering fine-tuning the model using our conversation history , i believe this could help it learn more about me and become more effective. While I’m not entirely sure if this approach is feasible for what I envision, it seems like an interesting idea, and I’m eager to explore it further.

I hope to write again soon.
