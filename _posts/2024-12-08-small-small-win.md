Over the past few days (from December 6 to December 8, 2024), I’ve been immersing myself in learning more about AI and working on building my dataset. Additionally, I’ve been exploring the process of fine-tuning a language model, and I’m happy to share that I’ve made some progress. While I realize this may not be groundbreaking to those with more experience in AI, I’m genuinely excited about the steps I’ve taken so far. Given that I’m still a beginner, every small success feels like a meaningful milestone.

Although the model wasn’t able to output 100% accurate data and did exhibit some hallucinations, I recognize that this is likely due to the small size of the dataset I created myself. It seems that it might just be lacking in certain areas, and I believe updating the dataset will help improve the model’s performance.

Looking ahead, I’m considering fine-tuning the model using "our" conversation history, as this could help it learn more about me and become more effective. While I’m not entirely sure if this approach is feasible for what I envision, it seems like an interesting idea, and I’m eager to explore it further.

I hope to write again soon.
