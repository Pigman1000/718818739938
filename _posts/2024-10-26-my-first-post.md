Hi, I decided to start this blog as a means for me to stay honest, transparent, and share my story, my thoughts, and my journey through life. I'm not sure how much I should share because this is different from a private journal, so I guess I'll have to figure that out. I'm not certain if I can keep this up in the long run or if the benefits outweigh the disadvantages, but I promise to try my best and to always be honest and transparent.  
  
I will be using ChatGPT to correct my English grammar because I'm not a native English speaker, but I'll do my best to keep the content my own creation. I'll probably use ChatGPT to help structure the format of these posts, as I'm still not sure if I need a consistent structure or about the frequency of posts. I know nothing; I'm not even sure the reason I started this blog is what I claimed, and I'm unsure if it will lead to the results I expect. I'm not even sure what those expectations are.  
  
But I guess this is it for the first post. To anyone who stumbles into this blog and reads this post, I hope you know that you are blessed, you are loved, and you deserve to love yourself as much as you can.

_Note: This was my first post, originally shared on Blogger on September 24, 2024. I recently decided to move to WordPress, but I didn’t want to leave my posts behind, so I’ve reposted it here as they were._
