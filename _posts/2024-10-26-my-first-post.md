**Note:** This post was originally meant to symbolize the beginning of my blogging journey. It has now been repurposed as a changelog , a space to share updates about my website and projects, tracking my progress, changes, and key milestones as I continue to develop and refine my platform and content. For specific details about the updates, you can refer to the index, which is organized by dates.

# My First Post

Hi, I decided to start this blog as a means for me to stay honest, transparent, and share my story, my thoughts, and my journey through life. I'm not sure how much I should share because this is different from a private journal, so I guess I'll have to figure that out. I'm not certain if I can keep this up in the long run or if the benefits outweigh the disadvantages, but I promise to try my best and to always be honest and transparent.

I will be using AI to correct my English grammar because I'm not a native English speaker, but I'll do my best to keep the content my own creation. I'll probably use ChatGPT to help structure the format of these posts, as I'm still not sure if I need a consistent structure or about the frequency of posts. I know nothing.

But I guess this is it for the first post. To anyone who stumbles into this blog and reads this post, I hope you know that you are blessed, you are loved, and you deserve to love yourself as much as you can.

## Update: October 27, 2024

This was my first post, originally shared on Blogger on September 24, 2024. I recently decided to move to WordPress, but I didn’t want to leave my posts behind, so I’ve reposted it here as they were.

## Update: December 26, 2024

I've moved to a new platform! I’ve created my own website hosted on GitHub, and I’m excited to continue my journey there. Thank you to everyone who has supported me so far, and I hope this new chapter brings more opportunities to share my story and thoughts.

## Update: January 1, 2025

I've updated my GitHub website and I'm now using Jekyll. I originally started off building my own custom website, but I got stuck trying to create a posts page.

Although I really wanted (and tried) to build and maintain my own website with custom HTML, I realized I might spend too much time trying to define and maintain the website itself. It detracts from the purpose I started documenting my thoughts and putting myself out there, and also, I fear it might interfere with my main projects.

The website, though still under construction, is functional, and I suppose it's just a matter of time before I figure out how to customize this to my own liking better.

I've also decided to use this post as a place for site updates, where I'll share updates about my website and projects. Stay tuned for more!
