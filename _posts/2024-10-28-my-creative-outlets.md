This might sound a bit cringe because not everyone can relate, but growing up, comic books were my entire world. They weren’t just entertainment—they were my escape, my inspiration, and the spark that fueled my creativity. For the longest time, they were all I had, at least until my father bought me a Walkman when I got older.

I still remember that day vividly—a small bamboo hut perched on a hill in the middle of town. It’s a memory that stands out as one of my happier days, though it feels strange to say that now. Looking back, life felt perfect in its own way, despite the hardships. I think about my mother today and the state she’s in, and I’d give anything to bring back the health and happiness she once had.

While others my age were busy playing Virtua Cop on Windows 98 or watching TV shows, I spent my days sneaking comic books from the local store and sketching the characters and worlds that captivated me.

Looking back, I realize those moments planted the seeds for my love of art. Although I don’t sketch anymore, those early experiences undoubtedly shaped my creative interests. They’re why I eventually ventured into 3D art and why I’ve always felt a deep connection to music. Even though I’m far from mastering either, both remain hobbies that bring me immense joy.

Among the comics I devoured, *Archie Comics* stood out. I found Midge especially captivating, even though she rarely appeared in the main series. The rest of the *Riverdale* gang feels so vivid in my memory, though I struggle to recall the names of all their parents. That’s a rabbit hole for another day.

Of course, my love for comics wasn’t limited to *Archie*. I was equally drawn to the heroes of Marvel and DC—*Spider-Man*, *Hulk*, *Batman and Robin*, *Superman*, *Green Lantern*, and *The X-Men*. *He-Man and the Masters of the Universe* held a special place in my heart too, as did *Phantom* and some Indian comics like *Twinkle*. From *Twinkle*, I remember Chacha Chaudhary, Sabu, and the unforgettable Suppandi.

It makes me wonder if there are comic series I’ve completely forgotten—hidden gems buried in my childhood memories, waiting to be rediscovered.

But this isn’t just about nostalgia. It’s also a reflection on how those early passions shaped who I am today. This post marks a turning point for me—a step toward sharing my creative journey and thoughts.

### Appreciation for digital artists

I began learning 3D art in late 2020, diving into YouTube tutorials and experimenting with Blender. Although I don’t pursue it as rigorously anymore, 3D art remains a meaningful part of my life. I still find joy in watching stunning renders and admiring how artists bring their visions to life. It’s much like my relationship with music—I no longer actively seek out new songs, but when one resonates, it finds its way into my playlist.

One thing about 3D work that continues to fascinate me is the sheer creativity and attention to detail that artists pour into their craft. It’s not just about making something look good; it’s about understanding the anatomy, structure, and behavior of objects in different conditions—caustics, god rays, shading, lighting, and countless other elements that we often overlook.

I remember watching a tutorial on creating realistic trees and realizing how much thought goes into even the smallest details. Despite being surrounded by trees my whole life, I never considered how different a sapling is from a fully grown tree, or how you can’t just slap leaves onto branches. They have to attach to twigs in a way that feels natural. The type of leaf matters too—certain leaves only grow on specific trees, and getting that wrong instantly breaks the illusion of realism. Even if we can’t always pinpoint what’s off, the human mind notices.

It’s details like these that remind me of how much effort goes unnoticed in the work of VFX artists. They don’t get nearly enough credit for the incredible skill and patience it takes to bring these creations to life. It’s a niche skill set—one that demands both technical expertise and a deep appreciation for art. And perhaps that’s the beauty of it: for those who truly understand, it’s not just work; it’s a passion, a labor of love.

Reflecting on all this, I feel even more inspired to continue exploring creativity in all its forms—whether through 3D art, music, or other pursuits. Here’s to the journey, wherever it leads. And hopefully, along the way, I’ll have the chance to share more of my work and experiences.
