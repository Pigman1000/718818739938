I read a lot of comic books growing up and it was the only form of entertainment for me , atleast until i got abit older and my father bought me a walkman . While kids my age were watching TV Shows and playing virtual cop on Windows 98 , I was busy stealing comic books and sketching.

Looking back i think that's probably why I love art , although I don't draw and sketch anymore. It probably contributed to why I developed an interest in learning 3D Art and feel i have a connection to music although i'm hardly there in terms of being able to create a piece that's even half commendable because in the end they are but a hobby.

I enjoyed reading Archies and i always thought Midge was attractive although she hardly shows up in the main series ,Â  maybe that's why I grew up to be more like Moose.

I remember these characters very well apart from the last four , although I cant seem to recall the names of all these characters' parents , gonna have to look it up later.

I also enjoyed Marvel and DC Comics , but they were always mostly Spider-Man , Hulk , Batman , Robin , Superman , Green Lantern and the X-Men . I also read He-Man and Master's of the Universe , Phantom and some Indian comics like Twinkle although the only characters I remember from Twinkle are Cacha Chaudhary , Sabu and last but not the least Suppandi.

These are some series i remember very well even if I can't remember all the characters , i wonder if there's any series i cannot recall but i guess I'll never know unless I come across them.

Anyways lemme stop reminiscing on comic book characters , the whole point of this post was to explore how my interests were formed and also as a marker since i've decided to start sharing my creative journeys as well as my thoughts.

I picked up 3D in late 2020 and started learning from youtube university and the most obvious software was Blender and although I don't actively learn and try to dive deeper into the realm of 3D Artistry , it is still very much a part of my life and i still very much enjoy watching renders and i still very deeply admire how people express their creativity in their art like how i don't actively seek out new songs anymore but I'll still add them to my playlist when I come across one i like - like everyone else .

Heres to be being hopeful i'll have the opportunity to share some of my works.
