excerpt: "This will be a bit cringe cuz not everybody can relate but then again , it's not my fault if you think this is childish. 
Growing up, comic books were my entire world. They were more than just entertainment—they were my escape, my inspiration, and my creative spark. For the longest time, they were all I had, at least until my father bought me a Walkman when I got older. While everyone was busy playing *Virtua Cop* on Windows 98, I spent my days stealing comic books from the local store and sketching the characters and worlds I admired so much."

This will be a bit cringe cuz not everybody can relate but then again , it's not my fault if you think this is childish. 
Growing up, comic books were my entire world. They were more than just entertainment—they were my escape, my inspiration, and my creative spark. For the longest time, they were all I had, at least until my father bought me a Walkman when I got older. While everyone was busy playing *Virtua Cop* on Windows 98, I spent my days stealing comic books from the local store and sketching the characters and worlds I admired so much.

Looking back, I realize those moments planted the seeds for my love of art. Although I don’t sketch anymore, those early experiences undoubtedly shaped my creative interests. They’re why I eventually ventured into 3D art and why I’ve always felt a deep connection to music. Even though I’m far from mastering either, both remain hobbies that bring me immense joy.

Among the comics I devoured, *Archie Comics* stood out. I found Midge especially captivating, even though she rarely appeared in the main series. Maybe that’s why I always felt more like Moose as I grew older—unassuming but deeply loyal. The rest of the *Riverdale* gang feels so vivid in my memory, though I struggle to recall the names of all their parents. That’s a rabbit hole for another day.

Of course, my love for comics wasn’t limited to *Archie*. I was equally drawn to the heroes of Marvel and DC—*Spider-Man*, *Hulk*, *Batman and Robin*, *Superman*, *Green Lantern*, and *The X-Men*. *He-Man and the Masters of the Universe* held a special place in my heart too, as did *Phantom* and some Indian comics like *Twinkle*. From *Twinkle*, I remember Chacha Chaudhary, Sabu, and the unforgettable Suppandi.

I sometimes wonder if there are comic series I’ve completely forgotten—hidden gems buried in my childhood memories, waiting to be rediscovered.

But this isn’t just about nostalgia. It’s also a reflection on how those early passions shaped who I am today. This post marks a turning point for me—a step toward sharing my creative journey and thoughts.

I began learning 3D art in late 2020, diving into YouTube tutorials and experimenting with Blender. Although I don’t pursue it as rigorously anymore, 3D art remains a meaningful part of my life. I still find joy in watching stunning renders and admiring how artists bring their visions to life. It’s much like my relationship with music—I no longer actively seek out new songs, but when one resonates, it finds its way into my playlist.

Here’s to embracing creativity, wherever it leads. And hopefully, I’ll have the chance to share some of my work along the way.
