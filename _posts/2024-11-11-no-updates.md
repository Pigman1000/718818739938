I haven't updated my blog the last few weeks because I've been extra busy trying to create a context system for an ai and i've been partially sucessful , there are some fluctuations in the AI's behaviour, it can retain some context from message history but I'd like to refine this by adding a summarisation of the conversation , this could be easy if I used another ai agent but I'm abit hesitant to add another ai to the mix. I'm doing all of this using ChatGpt with zero knowledge on coding language and it's on android.

I'm hopeful I'll be able to create something usable for myself though I need to refine the context system well enough to implement ways for it to fetch personal data and even allow it to take control of my storage system which theoretically translates to the ai creating a better system for itself.

Hope to continue writing !!

Hope i succeed!!!
