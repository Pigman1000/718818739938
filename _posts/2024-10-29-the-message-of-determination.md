Who would have thought it's possible for one lone man to carve a path through a mountain with just a chisel and a hammer yet it's been done.

It sounds insignificant , and even foolish yet it's the reason why this message will live on, I have no doubts about it.

The question is what else could he have done ?

Is it stupid because it's hard work ?

A man raised somewhere more distant from the "modern world" wouldn't have had access to the things we know and take for granted that makes our lives easier , but does it actually make him ignorant just because we supposedly know better and perceive ourselves to be more in-tune with reality ? Or is it he who's more in-tune with reality ? The reality of existence — when the message is so relative to the very core of our human nature and will remain relevant.

It's not just a message but a practical example of what human determination can do.

He did alone , something that would take hundreds of men with heavy machinery a couple years but it's not the speed or the ease at which the task was completed that's important here , it's about what he did.

So what do I tell myself about the life that he lived ? Do i assume he mindlessly dug and dug for over 2 decades so the example is invalid and has no value ? Isn't that a bit hypocritical to assume that we know people better than they know themselves when they found a way to live extraordinary lives as ordinary men and lived it when i'm stuck here trying to decipher the message and looking for ways to make it irrelevant because the circumstances are not the same?

It may just be because i somehow know deep inside that I do not have this determination, it may be because I associate the value of my purpose with acceptance and recognition that it feels insignificant, maybe because I'm still not truly aware of how we are all connected  as a species so it's not just this message that's important, but a fusion of everything because ultimately , we all know this deep inside.

It's not something new or profound , so words become just a tool to communicate , it's the practical example.

So i suppose if sharing these thoughts and blogging is the last thing I do , exploring my inner self and challenging my biases becomes my very own mountain and exposing myself  becomes, me carving a little piece of that mountain , until then I can keep looking for something much more simpler and maybe then I'll find contentment in my purpose.
