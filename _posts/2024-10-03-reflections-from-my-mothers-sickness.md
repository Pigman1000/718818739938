I find myself in a very real phase of my life, and I realize that there is no avoiding what lies ahead. I hope these reflections are not an attempt to escape but rather a way to process this moment.

Perhaps every moment has been real, but it’s this particular realization of where I am now that makes it feel more profound.

I often find myself wondering why people choose to have children, but I don’t feel it’s my place to speculate or make judgments. There’s a diversity of priorities that shape the world around us, and that’s something I’ve come to appreciate, even if I don’t always understand it.

But death—it’s undeniable and very real. The emotions tied to loss are raw, and the thought of losing someone is something we all carry with us. It can be overwhelming, and yet, it’s a reminder that change is the one constant we cannot escape. We often try to put it off or turn away, but it has a way of catching up with us when we least expect it.

What would the world be like without death? Would it take away some of the suffering, or would we just live in an endless state of stasis? Perhaps the pursuit of knowledge is our way of trying to understand these deep questions. If I had more education or wisdom, maybe I would have the answers to these ponderings.

I just hope I’m living up to my potential in this moment, and that I can honor my mother in a way that also honors myself. 

I write this post with the hope that it reminds me—and anyone reading—that we’re not alone in these experiences. Death is a natural part of life, and it’s how we live, with an awareness of this truth, that allows us to grow. Embracing this awareness helps us become more compassionate, more empathetic. Instead of fearing the unknown or separating life from death, perhaps it’s better to see both as part of the same journey—guiding us as we navigate the experiences of living.
