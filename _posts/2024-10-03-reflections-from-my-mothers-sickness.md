I'm in a very real phase of my life, and there is no way to escape what lies ahead. I hope these entries are not an attempt at escaping.

But then again , every moment has been real, it's just the realisation of coming back to this state of mind that makes it seem more real.

I don't understand why people have children, and I won't attempt to express why I think they do because I do not want to trigger a negative emotion in someone who might have a different outlook on life. I understand that it's this diversity in priorities that has shaped the world the way it is today.

Nevertheless, death is a very real part of life, and the emotions connected with it are as real as they get. The thought of losing someone is daunting, and the experience of loss is perhaps a reminder that change is the only constant. Yet, we often look for ways to escape, putting off the thought for another time, but it keeps creeping up on us until it hits us one day.

What kind of world would it be if there were no death? Would it alleviate suffering and hardships, or would we just exist in a static state? Isn't our collective pursuit of knowledge an attempt to understand and realize truth? Maybe I'd have the answers to all of this if I were more educated and knowledgeable.

I can only hope I'm living up to my potential and that I won't regret sharing these thoughts. I hope to do right by my mother so I can do right by myself.

Hopefully, this post serves as a reminder that I'm not alone in this, and that death is a real human experience. It's how we live our lives, while being mindful of this truth, that makes us grow as humans and be compassionate and empathetic. Rather than denying the possibility that anything can happen at any time or separating death from life, we would be better off if we used this awareness as the driver for the pursuit of the experience of living.
