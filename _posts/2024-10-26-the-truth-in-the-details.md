I’m not sure if I’ve mentioned this already, but I recently started learning about electricity. To me, this feels like a very natural path to follow—especially for someone trying to expand their knowledge. After all, electricity is literally the foundation on which the modern world is built.

I wouldn’t say my knowledge is extensive, but I do have a basic understanding of electricity. To me, "basic" means I can connect a hot wire to an outlet and understand how circuits work. Of course, I’m aware that there are people who can design intricate systems with microcontrollers—things like drones, robots, or automatic turrets that can track humans and shoot paintballs. If that’s the bar, I’m not quite there yet. But I do understand the basics of logic gates, frequencies, and digital signals. I can make LED diodes perform simple tasks, and I’ve even built a counter for 7-segment displays, so I think that counts as basic knowledge.

I share all of this to give some context to what I’ve learned about myself and how I process information.

Electricity is a technology rooted in our understanding of physics, and I always assumed—quite logically—that electrons in a circuit would follow the path described in conventional explanations: moving from positive to negative. I never really questioned this assumption. However, I’ve recently learned that this isn’t the case, and that realization led me to reflect on how we process information, and how much we subconsciously dismiss, even when it contradicts what we think we know.

For instance, I knew that electrons were negatively charged, but I never really paid much attention to what that meant for how they move in a circuit. It wasn’t until I was building a circuit in a simulation that the contradiction hit me, and I decided to dive deeper into the subject.

Learning that electrons actually flow from negative to positive, rather than the other way around, may not be groundbreaking news for most people. But for me, it was a revelation that helped me understand how we process information. Despite having access to the correct knowledge, I dismissed it until I encountered a contradiction.

This experience made me realize that we need to be not only observant of the information we process, but also aware of our own biases and assumptions. We must challenge our preconceived notions of what is logical or unnecessary in order to arrive at a deeper understanding of the world around us, especially when faced with contradictions.

This realization might only be a small piece of a much larger truth, but I believe it offers valuable insight into how we engage with knowledge and discovery.
