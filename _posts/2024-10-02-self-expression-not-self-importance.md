I can't help but feel that society has a negative perception of self-expression, to the point where it makes me question my own identity — _**Who do you think you are?**_ — as if I don't deserve to scribble down my thoughts, as if my inner self isn't real.

I understand these thoughts exist because I chose to share what's on my mind. Though nobody has actually verbalized these questions, it would be a lie to pretend they aren’t real. I see it in the negativity, in the subliminal responses, in their looks, their status updates, and in their own self-expressions.

I could simply ignore this negativity and pretend I don't understand the message, but that would defeat the purpose of self-expression. That's why I'm here, confronting the negativity, and I refuse to give in — to respond with negativity and stay trapped in that loop — because love begets love, kindness begets kindness, and positivity is contagious, even if that positivity is just internal.

I may not be wise, intelligent, or charming, and I might be playing into their hands, thinking this is all free will. But if I live my life doing what I believe is right and find peace within, then the truth doesn’t matter. My purpose is not to be perfect or strive for perfection; it's simply to acknowledge my imperfections.

Next time I’m met with negativity, I just have to remember that they’re on this journey too, and recognize that I might be the one who triggered it. We are all interconnected, no matter how distant our realities may seem.

I suppose that clarifies it: it's self-expression, not self-importance or delusion, because reality is what we make of it.

I don't have to deny or acknowledge it; I simply have to keep doing what I do — adapt, grow, and evolve.
