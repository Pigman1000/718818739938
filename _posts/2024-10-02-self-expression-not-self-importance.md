excerpt: "I can't help but feel that society has a negative perception of self-expression, making me question my own identity — as if I don't deserve to scribble down my thoughts, as if my inner self isn't real."

I’ve been thinking about the way society sometimes reacts to self-expression. It’s as though putting your thoughts out there invites the question — _**Who do you think you are?**_ — a question I often find myself asking, too. It’s strange how something as personal as sharing your mind can feel so exposed, so vulnerable, like you’re putting your sense of self on trial.

And yet, isn’t that the point of self-expression? To put a part of yourself into the world and let it exist, even if it’s imperfect, even if it’s misunderstood? Still, there’s always this subtle undercurrent, this unspoken skepticism in the air — in glances, in vague comments, in the echoes of their own expressions.

This isn't about criticizing society, as I'm part of it too, and I recognize that not everyone sees things the same way. However, to deny that self-expression can attract negativity is simply ignoring reality. A person with face tattoos is often viewed differently than someone in a suit and tie, as though one is lesser than the other, even if both play contradictory roles.

This brings to mind Friedrich Nietzsche's thoughts on how morality is often shaped by aesthetic standards. The problem with accepting societal norms for what is 'appropriate'—just because they’re deemed acceptable—is that they stem from conformity, negativity, and an appeal to authority. It’s a self-imposed limitation, almost as if simply being human isn’t enough.

I often wonder if, as a collective, we’ve always held these standards. Have we always been this way? Why can’t we treat a drunk man with the same level of respect, just because he’s not fully in his senses? Does ignorance of immorality somehow make an action moral? Does it absolve us from wrongdoing if no one knows? Are we really pursuing perception, or are we striving to live authentically?

Sometimes I wonder if it’s worth it. Wouldn’t it be easier to just stay silent, to keep my thoughts safely hidden where no one can challenge them? But that silence feels like a kind of dishonesty, a denial of who I am and who I’m trying to become.

I don’t know if I have the answers. I don’t know if self-expression always leads to growth or if it sometimes just stirs the waters. But I do know this: holding back out of fear of judgment or misunderstanding doesn’t feel right either.

I’m learning that self-expression isn’t about proving anything. It’s not about being right or even being understood. It’s about being honest with myself — about acknowledging the parts of me that I might otherwise keep hidden, not because they’re unworthy, but because they’re real.

When I encounter negativity, I try to remind myself that it’s often not about me. Maybe I’m just a mirror for something they’re grappling with. And maybe I am, too. It’s all connected, in a way that’s hard to define but impossible to ignore.

At the end of the day, I don’t need to have it all figured out. Self-expression isn’t a declaration of certainty; it’s an act of exploration. It’s me saying, “This is where I am right now,” and hoping that’s enough.

So, I’ll keep sharing. Not because it’s easy or because I’m sure of myself, but because it feels like the truest thing I can do.
