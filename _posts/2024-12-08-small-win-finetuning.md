Ive been learning about AI and still building my dataset and ive also been trying to learn how to fine tune an llm for the past couple of days (Dec-6 -2024 to Dec-8-2024) and im happy to report i've been somewhat successful , i understand this is probably nothing exciting to alot of people and nothing remarkable for those who are into AI and know all the ins and outs but  i'm pretty excited and i feel this is an achievement cuz i know the limits of my knowledge and im still just a beginner.

The model itself couldn't ouput 100% factual data and it hallucinated , but i realize its because the dataset was very small , one that i created myself and i assume its just missing data and if so its just a matter of updating the dataset.

I'm hoping to fine tune the model again on "our" conversation history soon , that way it could really learn about me and be more effective but im not sure if this is feasible for what i want it to do cuz i haven't really explored the idea yet but it sounds okay to me.

Hope to write again soon.
