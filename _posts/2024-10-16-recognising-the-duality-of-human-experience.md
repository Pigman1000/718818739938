Negativity and positivity are inherent in humans, and we do not have control over how and when these thoughts arise. While we might hope to prepare ourselves for negative feelings by identifying patterns and sequences leading to them, even sleep offers only a temporary pause in this mental dialogue.

Denying the existence of negative thoughts is a form of hypocrisy. Believing that only positive thoughts are constructive is illogical. If we equate our thoughts to processes in electricity, we see that a negative charge is equally responsible for the functioning of logic.

Ancient Chinese civilizations captured this duality in the concept of Yin and Yang, illustrating how these principles have outlived countless cultures and traditions, yet still hold true today.

It’s crucial to recognize that the negative thoughts we experience internally can manifest in others. Denying these thoughts is akin to denying the existence of those who share similar struggles. No matter what we do, there will always be individuals who question our intentions and motivations, often assigning them to negativity.

Ultimately, it’s about coming to terms with these internal negative thoughts and addressing them. While this may feel like a never-ending struggle at times, it is a vital part of being human. These challenges give our lives purpose and meaning, enabling us to experience emotions that ground our accomplishments in reality.

Consider that something we create today may seem perfect, yet there will come a time when we recognize its flaws. This is evident in the evolution of our technologies and morals informed by religion throughout history.

While we may not be able to address all these questions immediately, we can strive to separate ourselves from negative thoughts and approach them with kindness. This is self-compassion.

Acknowledge that these thoughts exist and that they are not you. Recognize why they arise and how you can overcome them.

Sharing these reflections in a blog post does not absolve me of my own negative thoughts or make me better at identifying them. It is a reminder of our interconnectedness as humans, from our thoughts and actions to the quantum level
