Negativity and positivity are part of me, and I don’t always have control over when or how these thoughts appear. While I try to prepare myself for negative feelings by recognizing patterns that lead to them, even sleep offers only a temporary pause in this ongoing mental dialogue.

It would be unkind to deny the existence of negative thoughts. The idea that only positive thoughts are helpful doesn’t quite make sense. If I think of my thoughts as processes, it becomes clear that even negative charges are necessary for things to work properly, like in electricity.

Ancient Chinese wisdom captures this balance in the concept of Yin and Yang, showing that this duality has remained relevant through countless cultures and traditions, and still holds true today.

It’s important for me to remember that the negative thoughts I experience inside can also show up in others. Denying these thoughts would be like denying the struggles of those around me. No matter what I do, there will always be individuals who question my intentions, sometimes seeing negativity where I may not have intended it.

Ultimately, coming to terms with these internal negative thoughts and working through them is part of my journey. Though it can feel like a never-ending struggle at times, these challenges give my life meaning, allowing me to experience emotions that make my accomplishments feel real and grounded.

I might create something today that feels perfect, only to notice its flaws later. This is something I see not only in my own work but also in the evolution of technology, morality, and the values shaped by religion throughout history.

While I may not have all the answers right away, I try to distance myself from negative thoughts and approach them with kindness. This is what I understand as self-compassion.

I acknowledge that these thoughts exist and that they are not me. I see why they arise and how I can gently move beyond them.

Writing these reflections in a blog post doesn’t mean I’m immune to negative thoughts or that I’ve mastered identifying them. It’s simply a reminder of how connected we all are as humans, from our thoughts and actions to the smallest parts of our existence.
