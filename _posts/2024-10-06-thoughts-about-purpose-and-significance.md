excerpt: "A few weeks back, I found myself grappling with thoughts of how insignificant and small I am, and i felt very overwhelmed with negativity. I’m not sure what triggered it—maybe my ongoing struggle for financial independence or my discomfort in my own body. Whatever the cause, it led me to reflect on my legacy. I realized I hadn’t been paying enough attention to it, but deep down, I want to be remembered—not just as someone who lived, but as someone significant. I think we all share this desire."

A few weeks back, I found myself grappling with thoughts of how insignificant and small I am, and i felt very overwhelmed with negativity. I’m not sure what triggered it—maybe my ongoing struggle for financial independence or my discomfort in my own body. Whatever the cause, it led me to reflect on my legacy. I realized I hadn’t been paying enough attention to it, but deep down, I want to be remembered—not just as someone who lived, but as someone significant. I think we all share this desire.

I’m not denying that I want to be remembered, nor am I saying I have no qualities or skills. Yet, I often feel like I have nothing meaningful to contribute, which leaves me thinking my aspirations may remain just dreams. No matter what I do, I can never find a purpose; a reason to live that feels worth it. This thought loops back and makes me feel small and worthless all over again when I think about how time will never stop and I'll just fade away like I never even existed.

It will keep going on and on, and I'll get buried in the past, forgotten. And this confuses me: what should I do? What can I do?

Amidst these feelings of worthlessness, I stumbled upon a video about Jadav Payeng, a man in Assam who dedicated his life to planting trees. It’s a video I’ve probably scrolled past a dozen times, thinking, “What’s the point? He’s just planting trees; nature will take care of itself.”

But this time, for some reason, I realized he truly is no ordinary man. His dedication to planting trees not only reforested a barren area but also symbolized the profound impact one individual can have on their community and the environment. I understand the deeper message behind what he’s done, even if I can’t fully articulate it. I see that I don’t need to say anything; we are all connected. It’s the people who seem the smallest who often have the biggest impact, and the purposes that appear the least significant can be the hardest to fulfill, yet they hold the most meaning.

This makes me reflect on how perfectly he lived his life, and it bothers me to realize that I’ve been blind to this for so long, surrounded by people like him who live quiet, humble, meaningful lives. This insight has given me a better understanding of life and purpose. I see now that there is no purpose too great or too small. I can’t express how grateful I am for this newfound sense of hope, especially when I felt worthless and insignificant, hopeless about ever finding a reason worth living—my purpose.

Though I still don't understand why I feel the need to articulate and express these thoughts, I hope that one day I can truly embody the man I envision in my mind and realize that I’ve always been him. Until then, I’ll embrace this uncertainty, knowing that every step I take matters.

How do we find purpose in our lives amidst the chaos, and can we truly recognize the significance of our actions? This was a thought I had a few weeks back, and I felt I should share it. I don't think I can capture that emotion ever again, but I'm hopeful I've captured the essence of it and expressed what I truly want to say. If not, I suppose I'll rewrite it when I revisit this post again some other time!
