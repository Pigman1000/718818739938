There's a common misconception that German Shepherd Dogs (GSDs) are always black and tan, and this misconception extends to the idea that black German Shepherds are not true GSDs. However, this couldn't be further from the truth.Â 

It's important to recognize that black German Shepherds are indeed part of the breed, and their color variations are often overlooked. The lack of comprehensive information online may contribute to this misunderstanding about their legitimacy as true GSDs.

The original German Shepherds were primarily black, with many of the early breeds showcasing a double coat. Horand Von Grafath, the first registered German Shepherd, had a predominantly black coat with a tan undercoat, which reflects the coloration seen in some of the earliest GSDs.

In discussing the lineage of German Shepherds, it's essential to recognize several influential dogs in the breed's history:

Horand Von Grafath, recognized as the foundation dog of the German Shepherd breed, was born in 1895 and became the first registered German Shepherd in 1899. His coat was primarily black with tan markings, a coloration characteristic of the early German Shepherds.

Horand's lineage includes notable dogs such as Hector Von Schwaben, who was known for his strength and temperament.

2\. Czech Working Line

3\. West German Show Line
