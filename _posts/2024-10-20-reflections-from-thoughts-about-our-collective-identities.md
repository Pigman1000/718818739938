I was just about to write something about our collective identities, but then I realized I shouldn’t point fingers when I’m just an extension of that collective. So, I’ve decided to refrain and instead confess.

I feel mildly disappointed when I observe the physical reality around me—the house I live in and the state of my body. I recognize that I am mildly obese, and my habits are far from healthy. I am in no position to be writing this, but I wonder: if I hadn’t been raised the way I was, if I hadn’t experienced all that I did, would I be who I am today? I wonder what  determinism would have to say about that.

I wonder if i hadn't changed if i would be in prison because that was a likely reality. I wonder if I'm confused about my own identity? Reflecting on my past, I question whether I should have stayed ignorant to these thoughts rather than jotting them down in a blog post as if I have gained some deeper insight and unlocked the secrets of the universe. Am I hallucinating? Did I mistakenly assume my identity as a mischief-maker and social outcast, or was that something a self-righteous society imposed on me? How can I be sure how i thought society perceived me as, is not just my imagination or confirm the reality behind the thought? How can I be sure if these thoughts are important? 

These questions arise alongside my internal self-perception. There’s evidence of my past in the minds of those who have known me. Did all these years of isolating myself from society cause this shift in me, or is this what I have always been internally? If not, why did I make the conscious choice to distance myself from people whose company I now don’t value?

All of this leads me to ask: who am I in the face of reality?

I realize I must start with myself. I need to focus on rebuilding the small house I live in, then extend my efforts to my community, contribute to society, and ultimately to my nation. Perhaps, in doing so, I can contribute to global causes and finally realize my potential as a human being, discovering my true identity.

However, I fear this will always remain a dream. I worry that I will continue to be the person who jots down thoughts, feeling self-aware yet never actualizing these reflections into actions. I’m not even sure what I expect from sharing these thoughts in such a busy world. I’m aware that they will likely remain unnoticed.

Perhaps, in the long run, these reflections will help me find myself, allowing me to observe my journey from an external perspective. Maybe this little self-reflection could even be of use to someone else.

And all of this because I thought about our collective identity as a species!
