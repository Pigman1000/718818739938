I was about to write something about our collective identities, but then I realized that I shouldn’t be pointing fingers when I am, in fact, an extension of that very collective. So, I’ve decided to step back and instead reflect.

There’s a mild sense of disappointment I feel when I look at my surroundings—my home, my body, and my habits. I recognize that I am mildly obese, and my habits are far from healthy. It’s strange to even be writing about this, but I can’t help but wonder: if I hadn’t been raised the way I was, if I hadn’t gone through what I’ve gone through, would I be who I am today? It’s a thought that brings determinism to mind.

I wonder, if I hadn’t changed, would I be somewhere else entirely, like in prison? That was once a likely reality. I ask myself: am I confused about my own identity? Should I have remained ignorant to these thoughts, rather than putting them out there, as though I’ve somehow gained profound insight into life? Am I mistaken in thinking I’ve unlocked some great truth, or am I merely creating an illusion? Did I construct my identity as a mischief-maker and social outcast, or was that how society chose to see me? How much of this perception is real, and how much is just a product of my imagination? How can I tell which of these thoughts truly matter?

These questions are tied to my inner sense of self. There’s a record of who I am in the memories of those who have known me. Did all those years of isolating myself change me, or was that always part of who I am? And if I’ve changed, why did I make the conscious decision to distance myself from people whose company I no longer value?

This all leads to a deeper question: who am I when I face the reality of who I’ve become?

I realize that I must start with myself. I need to begin by rebuilding the small house I live in and then extend my efforts to the people around me. From there, I can try to contribute to my community, my society, and eventually my nation. Perhaps, in doing so, I’ll also contribute to larger global causes and, in the process, find my true identity and realize my potential.

Still, a part of me fears that this will remain just a dream. I worry I’ll continue being the person who writes down these thoughts, feeling self-aware yet never quite bringing them to life in action. I wonder what I expect by sharing these thoughts in a world so filled with noise. I’m aware they may go unnoticed, and that’s okay.

But perhaps, in time, these reflections will help me understand myself better. Maybe they’ll allow me to observe my own journey from a clearer perspective. And perhaps, in some way, this small act of self-reflection might even offer something useful to someone else.

And all of this, sparked by a simple thought about our collective identity as human beings.
