Recently, I’ve felt like I’m losing my sense of self, and I’ve slipped back into making excuses and procrastinating.

I’ve missed over 10 days of journal entries , and I’ve always blamed my blogging for it — which was supposed to be a new habit — I understand that I don’t have to do both if I can capture enough in one, but it’s not easy to constantly question myself, my actions, and my thoughts.

It makes me wonder if it’s really possible to slip back into a state of nothingness—of not knowing my own thoughts or being unable to control them. But that’s something I hope never to find out. Hopefully, these journal entries and blog posts will help clarify things. Maybe someday, I’ll find myself and realize things I don’t yet know.

Recently, I’ve come to the realization that I need to schedule time for personal reflection at least once a day, so I don’t completely fall back. I’m hopeful for the future, no matter how slowly I’m moving. I know I need to do better, which is why I’m sharing these thoughts in a blog post yet again.

The point of self-reflection is to inform us, to help us make better decisions so we can live better lives. It’s arrogant and irresponsible to always be lost in thought, even if those thoughts are self-reflective. If we’re even a little aware, it’s only logical to schedule time daily and try to make it a habit—though I’m not sure if that’s even possible. Balancing reflection and engaging with the physical world is key.

Hopefully, I can see this through, and hopefully, this blog post helps.
