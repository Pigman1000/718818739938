I often tell myself that I’ve come to terms with the fact that I have little to offer humanity—not much for my family, friends, or the community I care about. But there’s still a part of me that clings to the hope that, through these reflections, I might offer something meaningful. Perhaps that’s wishful thinking, but I suspect many of us share these quiet thoughts, even if we don’t express them.

I’ve come to understand that education and connection are integral to shaping the reality we create. Yet, I find myself caught in a space between knowing I’m not learned enough to contribute in a conventional sense and understanding myself well enough to recognize the thoughts I carry.

I sometimes wonder how I’ll be remembered when I’m gone. Maybe they’ll say I was someone who struggled with the very essence of existence, someone who couldn’t fully reconcile with reality. But if that’s true, why would I expose myself to the possibility of judgment, hoping that someone might, even for a moment, find meaning in these words?

Perhaps, like many, I’ll simply fade into the background, but in the grand scheme of things, time is a construct we aren’t bound by.

My mother is nearing the end of her journey, but then again, who isn’t? The truth is, death is something we all must face. We live our lives, chasing dreams and creating the illusion of permanence, forgetting that death will come for all of us. We tend to think it’s far away, only for it to catch us off guard when we least expect it.

As difficult as it is to accept, I’m grateful that cancer has reminded us of this truth—that life is fleeting, and nothing is permanent.

I’m working on a project now, dedicating an hour a day to it. I struggle to stay consistent, often forgetting the small habits I’ve recently tried to cultivate, like watering the plants. I hope I don’t abandon this effort like I have with other things in the past.

Maybe, in some small way, this project will leave a trace of me behind—something worth remembering, even if it’s only for a short while.
