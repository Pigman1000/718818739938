I tell myself I've come to terms with the fact that I have nothing to offer humanity, not myself, my family , my friends or the community that i hold dear but perhaps I still hold onto the hope that I might contribute through these reflections, though I don’t see how, because I believe everybody has these thoughts, even if they don’t verbalize them.

I realize that education and connection are important to build on the reality we create, and I'm stuck somewhere in between. I'm not learned enough to say anything that makes sense to contribute, but I know myself just enough to have these thoughts.

I don’t know how I’ll be labeled when I’m gone. Maybe they’ll say I was someone who struggled with the fact that I exist and couldn’t come to terms with reality. But if that’s true, why am I even exposing myself to be criticized, in the hope that someone might come along and read these words?

Maybe I’ll just fade into oblivion, but either way, I’m not bound by time.

My mother is dying, but then, who isn’t? Whose mother isn’t? We live with the illusion of permanence, and we get lost chasing our dreams, living our lives, and we lose ourselves thinking death is still so far away that we don’t have to think about it now. But it creeps up on us and catches us unprepared.

So, as hypocritical and delusional as it may seem, I’m thankful that cancer has reminded us of this truth—that life is not permanent.

I'm working on a project, and I've dedicated an hour a day to it, though I struggle to follow my own schedule and constantly forget to water the plants a habit i recently developed. Hopefully, I don’t abandon it like I always do.

Maybe then I’ll leave a little trace of myself that's worth remembering, even if it’s only for a short while.
