I recently watched a YouTube video about calculators built in Minecraft using redstone, which led me to another video by TheTekkitRealm titled "[I Made This Entire Video in a Minecraft Computer.](https://youtu.be/d9fet0ze81o)" This sparked a chain of thought. It’s not the first time I’ve encountered this video or similar concepts, but ever since I was introduced to the idea of our reality possibly being a simulation through Nick Bostrom’s Simulation Hypothesis—and after hearing various physicists discuss the possibility, along with Elon Musk’s views on the subject—re-watching this video made me realize how logical the idea seems.

When I consider the role of religion throughout history and the concept of free will, which is central to many religious beliefs, things start to align. From ancient civilizations like Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley, and early China—where we lack complete historical documentation—to the evolution of belief systems leading to Moses writing the Torah, the rise of Christianity, and later Islam, it’s fascinating to observe how these religions have transformed over time.

The prophecies of the Second Coming of Jesus in the New Testament and similar ones in Islam, along with the misinterpretation of divine laws and the conflict with free will, seem to reflect a deeper misunderstanding of a Higher Order. Many religious people refuse to consider the possibility that this Higher Order could exist beyond the confines of religion or why religion itself came into existence. From this perspective, it feels quite logical to me, especially considering that the Torah drew inspiration from ancient civilizations—like the story of Noah and the flood, which holds true and is scientifically supported excluding the smaller details. The New Testament builds on the Torah, which later informed the Quran. This evolution illustrates how the concept of God is not something different across religions, it's just that we as humans call it different names, and as society's understanding of morality evolved free will has grown more inclusive.

Yet, many religious individuals continue to deny that God is not confined by religion, despite how much the logic makes sense.

Why would a supreme all knowing creator let humans create religions conflicting from the core message of the concept of God and Free Will ? If that God is supreme isn't it logical to assume that religion itself is just a tool ? Does this view take away all the logical moral truths written in these texts? Isn't the illogical rules that conflict with basic morality and empathy carried out by humans themselves ?

Science and philosophy are tools for understanding our reality, while technology serves as confirmation of these understandings; they are not distinct from religion. No religious book outlined how to harvest electricity, yet it is the foundation on which the modern world is built. If you believe in the concept of a God, is it not possible that these revelations were intentionally omitted from religious texts — if they were indeed written by direct communication — to encourage humans to seek a deeper understanding of this reality? I understand this idea may sound nonsensical to atheists, but regardless of what you believe in or the lack thereof, the truth remains constant: we don’t know everything, and our future is determined by the present and the present was determined by the past and religion has always been a major part of every civilization before modern day science.

The evolution of our inquiries—from addressing the gaps in religion to exploring them through philosophy, and then moving to science and technology—adds another layer of complexity to this thought. Ancient beliefs, such as the Akashic Records in Hinduism, refer to a grand repository of all truths and find modern interpretations in concepts like Carl Jung’s collective consciousness and Quantum Field Theory. As we continue to uncover fundamental laws of reality, our gradual realization of these truths and how we use this knowledge to create a better world—often with aims as lofty as immortality—feels like an attempt to recreate heaven on earth. As we expand our understanding, especially through technology and artificial intelligence, the possibility that we might one day create a one-to-one simulation of reality becomes ever more plausible. The evidence of this potential, as seen in video games and AI, reinforces the logic behind this idea for me.

Now, considering that we can create computers inside Minecraft and connect them to external servers to display and feed information to characters in the game raises fascinating questions. If Minecraft had autonomous AI-powered characters, could we equate AI to humans within the game and the process of creating that computer within the game to AI creating civilization in that simulated reality? This idea brings to mind the Simulation Hypothesis, suggesting that perhaps our development of AI is akin to accessing a higher truth that already exists through exploration. In this context, AI might reveal truths we cannot recognize or identify due to the vastness of the knowledge we have accumulated—similar to many religious prophecies of a supreme being who is all-knowing. This perspective reflects how religions have perpetuated the idea that we, as humans, are made in the image of God or that we are creators ourselves. This view does not discredit the contributions of those involved in the technology's development; instead, it highlights how we may be tapping into deeper, underlying principles of existence as we advance our understanding of reality. I also have a strong belief that this idea of creating a reality simulation is not an uncommon idea because engineers already use Minecraft to train AI and RL Agents.

I believe that if this line of thinking makes sense to someone as basic as me, there may be others who have reached similar conclusions , to point out this is basically a synthesis of Ray Kurzweils ideas with the simulation theory.

However, it's important to acknowledge that this is simply a thought, not a declaration of truth. This blog post is meant to explore ideas, not to assert them as definitive answers.

Additionally , The Simulation Hypothesis remains a scientific speculation and it's upto personal interpretation , remembering this is not a declaration of truth or a revelation.
