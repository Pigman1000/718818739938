## Journaling Is Healthy

For much of my life, I’ve struggled with doubt and uncertainty, often feeling insignificant and unsure of my place. However, keeping a journal has truly helped improve my mental well-being. While feelings of insignificance may always be a part of my journey, they serve as a reminder to keep living, and they give me the courage to express myself without hesitation. After all, what I write, no matter how distant from the truth it may seem or how deluded they might make me seem, Journaling offers me the opportunity to look back and reflect.

Sharing some of these entries publicly helps me validate my thoughts in a way that removes the chance of denying I had them. It’s a way of making sure I don’t brush off my feelings as fleeting by putting them out in the open. This process is about being honest—not just with others, but with myself.

At this point in my life, despite the challenges I face, I truly believe I’m happy. I may not always fully understand the truths that haunt me, but I know I can’t resist what fate has in store. And this fate is simply the human condition.

I write this as a gentle reminder that none of my other entries are meant to be declarations, even if they might sound like one. They just reflect how strongly I feel about something and create space for me to self-correct if needed. That’s all there is to it.
As I've come to learn  , random actions lead to random outcomes, and that remains true.
